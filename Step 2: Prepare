Data Ethics and Governance
All personal identifying details have been stripped from the dataset to uphold user privacy. This anonymization restricts the depth of analysis, particularly in 
identifying recurring casual users or confirming if they are local to the Chicago area.

Data Utilization for Strategic Planning
The main objective is to analyze the behavior of casual and member groups to formulate a strategic plan that encourages casual riders to upgrade to membership status.

Data Integration and Cleaning
The 12 separate monthly data files require consolidation into a single dataset to enable efficient analysis. Additionally, irrelevant variables have been pruned, 
and inaccuracies and redundancies have been removed to ensure data integrity.
